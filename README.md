<h4>Car Insurance</h4>
This MVC web application is a project that, like many existing insurance websites, calculates quotes based on user input business logic. It also contains an admin page that allows for edits and removal of potential customers. 

<h4>Second Project</h4>
I still have to work on my second project.
